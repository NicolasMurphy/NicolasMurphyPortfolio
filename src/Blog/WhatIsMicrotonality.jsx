          Whether you're a musician looking for new sounds or just curious about
          music beyond the usual 12 notes, this blog aims to make microtonality
          easier to understand and explore.

          When I first got into it, most of what I found was either overly
          technical or hard to apply. But the tools are more accessible than
          ever, and you've probably already heard microtonal music without
          realizing it.

          This post is a starting point—an invitation to explore a world of

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">Defining Microtonality</h2>

      <div className="space-y-5 mt-4 leading-relaxed text-base-content text-lg">
        <p>
          At its simplest, <strong>microtonality</strong> is music that uses
          pitches <strong>outside</strong> the usual 12 notes per octave. These
          in-between notes, or <em>microtones</em>, don't exist on a standard
          piano—but they show up in music from around the world and even in
          popular music.
        </p>

          As{" "}

            className="link link-primary"
          >
            Wikipedia
          </a>{" "}
          puts it, microtonality refers to “intervals smaller than a semitone”
          or any tuning that doesn't follow the standard Western 12-tone equal
          temperament system.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some folks prefer the term{" "}

          , since "microtonal" implies the intervals are smaller, which isn't
          always the case. “Microtonal” has become the more common term, but the
          two are often used interchangeably.
        </p>

        <p>
          For now, just think of microtonality as music that steps outside the
          usual rules of tuning—and opens up a much bigger world of sound.

          , or <strong>12-TET</strong>. It divides the octave into 12 equal
          parts, making it easy to switch keys and build chords that sound
          “correct” to most modern ears.

          We'll dive deeper into tuning systems like these in a future post. For
          now, just know that Western music's sound is rooted in a long,

        Microtones Already in Popular Music

      <div className="space-y-5 mt-4 leading-relaxed text-base-content text-lg">
        <p>
          Microtonality might sound like a niche concept, but chances are you've
          already heard it—especially in blues, jazz, hip-hop, and electronic
          music.
        </p>

        <p>
          One classic example is the{" "}

          >
            blue note
          </a>
          . In blues and jazz, a blue note is a pitch that's intentionally
          played or sung slightly “off” from the standard Western scale. These
          notes are often bent, slid into, or sit somewhere between major and
          minor. As Wikipedia puts it, blue notes are “usually said to be the
          lowered third, lowered fifth, and lowered seventh scale degrees” and
          often fall between semitones, making them a perfect real-world example
          of microtonality.

          Another more modern example is the{" "}

          These are just two examples, but they show how microtonality already

          <strong>Gamelan</strong> in Indonesia, and many Thai, Burmese, and
          African musical traditions.

          These systems don't follow the 12-note Western scale—they use

          Microtonality opens the door to sounds, feelings, and expressions that
          just aren't possible within the standard 12-note system. It lets us
          break away from the familiar patterns and explore new musical
          spaces—some ancient, some futuristic.

          <strong>Serum</strong>, and microtonal hardware synths. I'll also
          share my own experiments with alternate tunings and composition.

          Microtonality isn't just a curiosity—it's a way to rediscover music.
