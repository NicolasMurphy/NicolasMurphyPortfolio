          That quote sent me down a rabbit hole. It turns out this concept is
          called <strong>Protein Music</strong>, which has been explored since
          the 1980s. According to{" "}

          "Protein music or, more broadly, genetic music (including DNA music)
          is a musical technique where music is composed by converting protein
          sequences or DNA sequences to musical notes... Applications for
          genetic music proposed in the scientific literature include aids to
          memorization and education."

          Notable contributors include Susumu Ohno, who proposed that repetition
          is fundamental to both protein evolution and music composition.
          Others, like Jo√´l Sternheimer, even theorized that music could
          influence protein synthesis, though such claims remain controversial.
        </p>

        <p>
          Researchers have also observed that converting DNA and protein
          sequences to sound can reveal patterns and periodicities not easily
          seen through traditional analysis. This makes protein music not just a
          compositional tool, but also a unique method of data exploration.

        <p>
          When I first stumbled across the excerpt at the top, I was immediately
          interested. Was it possible to influence your hormonal state through
          sound? How did he play the sounds of thyroxin? As someone interested
          in more experimental music, I knew I had to explore this idea further.

          My First Attempts (Max/MSP)
        </h2>
        <p>
          I started manually constructing "protein music" in{" "}
          <strong>Max/MSP</strong>, assigning frequencies and volume to
          estimated molecular weights. It was quite a manual process, and not
          completely accurate. I needed real data ‚Äî something more precise, and
          a way to automate the process.

        <p>The results? Mostly strange.</p>
        <p>
          Most molecules ended up sounding metallic, glitchy, or bell-like ‚Äî
          interesting, but not very usable in my compositions. But one stood
          out:

          Since it sounded so similar to a harpsichord, it felt natural to pair
          it with a piece of Bach. I sampled the oxytocin-generated tone and
          used it to render{" "}

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          I was pretty dedicated to this idea at first, I had plans to make an
          album titled "Sonus Hormonae", using sounds entirely from spectra
          data. But I found it too restrictive of a concept ‚Äî difficult to make
          the resulting music enjoyable for me to actually listen to. However I
          still find this idea interesting. The possibility that these sounds
          could have a real effect on our physiological state I believe is still
          worth exploring.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, I will continue to explore other musical avenues, but I may
          come back to this concept in the future. In the meantime, if you're
          curious, feel free to explore the project. There are roughly 100 .wav
          files in the GitHub repo, or try generating your own using the script.
